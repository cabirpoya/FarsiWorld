I can guide you on how to start making “Farsi World” real and turn it into a website, but I can’t directly create or launch live websites myself. Here’s how you can move forward:  ### 1. Build with Notion (Simple Start) - **Publish Your Vision:** You can use your Notion page as a public website to showcase the vision and features of Farsi World. Open your Notion page, click “Share,” and enable “Publish to web.” [[1]](https://www.notion.so/help/public-pages-and-web-publishing) - **Customize Appearance:** Add callouts, images, or databases for poets/poems to simulate sections of your platform. Customize the favicon and visuals for a branded feel. [[2]](https://www.notion.so/help/edit-and-customize-your-notion-sites) - **Get Feedback:** Share the link with collaborators or early users to start building a community.  ### 2. Next Steps for a Real Web Platform To develop a fully interactive, visually rich, and AI-powered platform like your vision, you’ll need a team and some key phases:  - **Team Up:** Find web developers, designers, and possibly AI/AR specialists (freelance or agency). - **MVP (Minimum Viable Product) Planning:** Start with core features—poet/poem database, search, translation, and user registration. - **Choose Tech Stack:**    - For content-rich, interactive sites: React, Next.js, or Vue.js are popular.   - For backend: Node.js, Python (Django), or similar.   - For database: PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc. - **Hosting:** Use platforms like Vercel, Netlify, or traditional hosting for deployment. - **Iterate with User Feedback:** Launch a beta version and continuously improve. - **Consider Partnerships:** Collaborate with universities or cultural organizations for content and outreach.  ### 3. Showcase & Pitch - Use your detailed Notion page as a launchpad to:   - Recruit collaborators/co-founders.   - Pitch to investors or cultural sponsors.   - Attract early users and contributors.  ---  **Summary:**   You can start now by publishing your Notion vision online for sharing and feedback. For the full-featured website, consider building an MVP with a technical team. If you want a basic site set up in Notion or help with a step-by-step web project plan, just let me know what level you'd like to start at!
